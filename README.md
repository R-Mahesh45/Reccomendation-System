# Recommender System Using Cosine Similarity

This project implements a recommender system to suggest items based on cosine similarity scores. The system calculates similarity between items or users to recommend relevant content. It is particularly useful for applications like e-commerce, movie recommendations, or personalized content delivery.

---

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a recommender system using cosine similarity scores. The system calculates similarities between entities (e.g., users, items) to recommend the most relevant items based on their similarity to a target entity.

---

## Features

- Calculate cosine similarity between entities (rows or columns of a dataset).
- Filter and analyze a specific section of the similarity matrix (e.g., rows 100-200 and columns 100-200).
- Generate personalized recommendations for users or items based on similarity scores.

---

## Dataset

The project uses a sample dataset with rows and columns representing entities (e.g., users, items, or features). The dataset is processed to create a cosine similarity matrix for recommendations.

---

## Approach

1. **Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to ensure all entities are represented in a numerical format suitable for similarity calculation.
2. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity is computed for all entities in the dataset.
3. **Filtering**: A subset of the similarity matrix is extracted using `use_cos_df.iloc[100:200, 100:200]` for focused analysis.
4. **Recommendations**: The top-k similar entities are identified for each target entity based on the cosine similarity scores.

## Results

- Successfully computed cosine similarity for the given dataset.
- Extracted and analyzed the relevant section of the similarity matrix.
- Generated recommendations based on similarity scores.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and computation.
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation and filtering.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For cosine similarity computation.
